Note to Rover.com:

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this data set,
I really enjoyed diving into it and picking it apart! I wanted to
note a few things:

1. Since the answers were given for Excersize 1, I wrote it as a
unit-test and didn't include the results in the presentation. I 
hope this is alright.

2. I did a lot of extraneous work (error checking, experimenting with
visualizations) that I didn't include in the final presentation so as 
not to weigh down the results. I kept most of it in the source-code 
(just commented out) to give some idea of my thought process.

3. The presentation itself is a little more cluttered than I usually do,
this is because I don't have the luxury of being there to present it, so
I wanted to make sure everything I would have said out-loud was written
down clearly. I hope this is ok!

Thanks again,
Toby Badman
